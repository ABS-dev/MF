\usage{
MFClusBootHier(
  formula,
  data,
  compare = c("con", "vac"),
  nboot = 10000,
  boot.unit = TRUE,
  boot.cluster = TRUE,
  which.factor = "All",
  alpha = 0.05,
  seed = sample(1:1e+05, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula Formula of the form y ~ x + a/b/c, where y is a
continuous response, x is a factor with two levels of treatment, and a/b/c
are grouping variables corresponding to the clusters. Nesting is assumed to
be in order, left to right, highest to lowest. So a single level of "a"
will contain multiple levels of "b" and a single level of "b" will contain
multiple levels of "c".}

\item{data}{a data.frame or tibble with the variables specified in formula.
Additional variables will be ignored.}

\item{compare}{Text vector stating the factor levels - compare[1] is the
control or reference group to which compare[2] is compared.}

\item{nboot}{number of bootstrapping events}

\item{boot.unit}{Boolean whether to sample observations from within those of
the same core.}

\item{boot.cluster}{Boolean whether to sample which cores are present. If
TRUE, some trees have all the cores while others only have a subset.}

\item{which.factor}{Which variables to include in the mitigated fraction
summation. Default is 'All', to sum over entire tree.}

\item{alpha}{Passed to \code{emp_hpd} to calculate high tailed upper and high
tailed lower of mitigated fraction.}

\item{seed}{Passed to \code{\link{MFhBoot}} to to initialize random number
generator for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements: \cr \cr \itemize{ \item
  \strong{MFhBoot} as output from \code{\link{MFhBoot}}. \item
  \strong{MFnestBoot} as output from \code{\link{MFnestBoot}}. }
}
\description{
Combines \code{\link{MFhBoot}} and \code{\link{MFnestBoot}} into
  a single function.
}
\note{
\code{Core} variable is the variable corresponding to the lowest nodes
  of the hierarchical tree. \code{Nest} variables are those above the core.
  \code{All} refers to a summary of the entire tree.
