# INTRODUCTION {-}

This document is intended to provide additional details regarding the algorithms
used for calculating mitigated fraction values for hierarchical data as
implemented in package `MF` via the functions `MFClusHier`, `MFnest`,
`MFClusBootHier`, and `MFnestBoot`. A passing familiarity is helpful in
understanding the examples and underlying data input in this guide.
A quick start may be found at
[Quick Start when calculating MF from Hierarchical Data](https://github.com/ABS-dev/MF/blob/master/inst/doc/QuickStartHierData.pdf).

## Data assumptions. Nested Hierarchical structure. {-}

Examples in this document expect data to be structured in a *nested hierarchical
tree*, as shown in Table 1. If there are only two variables (columns) or the
experimental design is not nested, then the methods described here may not apply.
A nested design assumes that the factor of one variable co-occur with another
variable. For example, Pen D exists only within Room Z. If the experimental
design of the data set is crossed (all factors of a variable co-occur with
all factors of another variable), it is not appropriate to use this guide as
written.

```{r expdesign, echo = FALSE}
kbl(a, 
    align = "c", 
    row.names = FALSE,
    caption = "Nested hierarchical data structure.")  |>
  kable_styling("bordered", 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                font_size = 8) |>
  collapse_rows(columns = 1:4, 
                valign = "middle")
```


# DETERMINING MITIGATED FRACTION {-}

## Rank tables. {-}

Deterimining the rank table is the first step of the algorithm. For each
*cluster*, the following values are determined:

- `con_n` & `vac_n`: Counts of observations for each treatment (control or
vaccinate) for a particular instance of a unique factor level of a variable.
- `n1n2`: Product of counts, `con_n` * `vac_n`.
- `w`: Wilcoxon statistic.
- `u`: Mann-Whitney statistic.
- `con_medResp` & `vac_medResp`: Median observation for each treatment
(control or vaccinate) in a particular instance of a unique factor level of a variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
thismfh <- MFh(formula = lung ~ tx + room / pen / litter, data = a)
thismfh
```

A *cluster* refers to the full grouping designation of each observation.
For example, in Table 1 the cluster of the first observation is
Room W/Pen A/Litter 11, and there are four observations within that cluster.

The values in the rank table is the same regardless of the variable of interest.
That is, whether a user is interested in the value of mitigated fraction for variable
"pen" or "litter" does not affect the content of rows or columns, assuming the
same input data.


### Using package MF. {-}

Rank tables can be output with the following usage in package `MF`:

- `MFClusHier(...)$MFh`: Rank table field from `MFClusHier()` output,
calculated from input data.
- `MFh(...)`: Calculate just the rank table from input data.
- `MFClusBootHier(...)$MFhBoot`: List which includes rank table using
bootstrapped input data as `...$bootmfh` and calculated directly from
inputdata as `...$mfh`.
- `MFhBoot(...)`: List which includes rank table using
bootstrapped input data as `...$bootmfh` and calculated directly from
inputdata as `...$mfh` without the additional `...$MFnestBoot` output.

## Summarizing the rank table. {-}

With a detailed rank table, it is possible to calculate the mitigated fraction
for a variety of variable choices. This is the second step of the algorithm. For each variable of interest the following
summations are calculated for each level of that variable.

- `N1N2`: Sum of the `n1n2` values from the rank table for the factor level
designated in the row.
- `U`: Sum of the `u` values from the rank table for the factor level
designated in the row.
- `con_N` & `vac_N`: Sum of the counts from the rank table matching the
particular factor level
designated in the row.
- `con_medResp` & `vac_medResp`: Median of responses for each comparison
group matching the particular factor level of the row.
- `MF`: $2 * U/N1N2 - 1$.

The following example looks at the mitigated fraction of factors in variable "pen".
We can see that the values for "N1N2" have been summed from the previous rank
table for all cases of "Pen A", "Pen B", etc.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
MFnest(thismfh, which.factor = "pen")
```

It is possible to perform this summary without regard for variables to get
an overall mitigated fraction value.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
MFnest(thismfh, which.factor = "All")
```

### Using package MF. {-}

- `MFClusHier(...)`: calculates rank table and MF table as a single step.
- `MFnest(...)`: calculates MF table from rank table.
- `MFClusBootHier(...)`: calculates rank table and MF table as a single step,
with bootstrapping.
- `MFnestBoot(...)`: calculates MF table including  from bootstrapped rank table.


# BOOTSTRAPPING {-}

Bootstrapping can occur in one of two points of consideration: at *clusters*
or at *units*.

## Resampling clusters. {-}

In Table 1 the cluster of the first observation is
Room W/Pen A/Litter 11, and there are four observations within that cluster.
Bootstrapping clusters samples from the unique clusters with replacement, so
every instance will have the same number of clusters as the original data, but
they may not be unique. The example below shows one possiblility of a bootstrap
instance from the example data.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mfboot_multiple <- MFClusBootHier(formula = lung ~ tx + room / pen / litter,
                                  data = a, boot.unit = FALSE,
                                  boot.cluster = TRUE, alpha = 0.1,
                                  which.factor = c("room", "litter", "All"))
mfboot_multiple$MFhBoot$bootmfh |>
  filter(bootID == 1) |>
  select(c("bootID", "room", "pen", "litter"))
```

During bootstrapping of clusters, the observations within that cluster do not
change composition. That is, Room W/Pen A/Litter 11 continues to have the same
two vaccinates (5.63, 4.62) and the same two controls (9.20, 7.28).


## Resampling units. {-}

Bootstrapping the unit involves sampling with replacement the observed
values within a particular comparison group for that cluster. The mix of control
and vaccinate groups remains constant for a unique cluster and determines the number of
sampling events. For example, the cluster Room W/Pen A/Litter 11 has
2 vaccinates and 2 controls. Bootstrapping the unit involves sampling
with replacement twice from the observed response of samples in the selection
Room W/Pen A/Litter 11/vac and twice from the observed response of samples in
the selection Room W/Pen A/Litter 11/con for each instance of the cluster
Room W/Pen A/Litter 11. The number of times that a unique cluster exists in the
bootstrapped data is determined by sampling of the clusters (see above
discussion).

After bootstrapping at the unit level, a particular instance of the cluster
Room W/Pen A/Litter 11 will continue to contain two vaccinates but the values
may both be 5.63 while the two controls may have the values (7.28, 9.20).
